# SimpleStockTracker

Simple Stock Tracker is a .NET Core MVC Web Application using C#,
which integrates with a SQL Server database hosted on Azure to perform CRUD operations.

This application is designed to be an easy way to keep track of your stock investment accounts and their holdings.

On the Accounts page, users are shown a list of accounts they have entered. From there, they can create new accounts, view details of existing accounts, edit existing accounts, or delete existing accounts.

On the Holdings page, users are shown a list of holdings (displayed as Buys and Sells of stock shares) and what account they were purchased in. As with the accounts page, they can then create a new holding, view details of existing holdings, edit existing holdings, or delete existing holdings.
